### **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Model Benchmarking and Analysis**

## **Introduction**
This project explores **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** by leveraging multiple speech-to-text models, including **Google Speech API, OpenAI Whisper, CMU Sphinx, and Facebook Wav2Vec2**. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these models and analyze their effectiveness in transcribing audio while incorporating **audio preprocessing, noise reduction, and keyword extraction**.

## **Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to implement and benchmark different **ASR models** by processing raw speech data, applying noise reduction, and comparing transcriptions from various models. The project aims to:
- **Preprocess audio files** for optimal recognition.
- **Reduce background noise** to enhance speech clarity.
- **Benchmark ASR models** to compare accuracy and efficiency.
- **Extract key insights** from transcriptions to identify relevant keywords.

## **Key Highlights**
### **Comprehensive Speech Processing**
- **Audio Preprocessing:** Converts raw audio into a standardized format (**mono, 16-bit, 16kHz WAV**).
- **Noise Reduction:** Uses `noisereduce` to eliminate background noise.

### **Advanced ASR Model Benchmarking**
- **Google Speech API**: Cloud-based ASR for high-accuracy speech recognition.
- **OpenAI Whisper**: Deep learning-based ASR with multilingual support.
- **CMU Sphinx**: Offline ASR with open-source capabilities.
- **Facebook Wav2Vec2**: Transformer-based ASR leveraging pre-trained speech models.

### **In-Depth Performance Evaluation**
- Evaluates transcription quality by **extracting key insights** from transcribed text.
- Compares **short and long audio segments** for ASR model benchmarking.

## **Distinctive Project Features**
### **Speech-to-Text Accuracy Testing**
- Tests multiple ASR models to compare transcriptions and analyze accuracy.

### **Keyword Extraction**
- Identifies relevant **keywords** in transcribed text to enhance speech analytics.

### **Short Audio Segmentation**
- Extracts **first 5 seconds** of speech for focused benchmarking of ASR models.

## **Project Impact**
This project provides a **structured pipeline** for **speech recognition and benchmarking**. By integrating multiple ASR models and **enhancing speech processing**, the project helps in selecting the most **efficient and accurate ASR models** for different use cases, such as **transcribing meetings, voice commands, and spoken dialogues**.
